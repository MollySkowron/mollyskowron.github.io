## In a science classroom, students should be treated as scientists. They should be respected and their ideas should be valued.

#### Think-Pair-Share

Many times throughout a lecture, a question is posed to the class and students discuss it with the person next to them. After a few minutes, each group shares what they discussed.

#### Peer Instruction

Students frequently come up to the board to solve problems or draw diagrams. These students then explain to the class how they arrived at the answer they did.
