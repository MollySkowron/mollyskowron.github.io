## In the classroom, students should be respected and their ideas should be valued.


#### Peer Instruction &mdash; how students assist the learning of other students

Students frequently come up to the board to solve problems or draw diagrams. These students then explain to the class how they arrived at the answer they did.

Another example of peer instruction was the body systems poster gallery walk presentation. All posters were hung up around the room, and for the first half of the period, half the students presented their posters while the other half of the students walked around to learn from their peers. For the second half of the period, the roles were switched so that every student got the opportunity to present.

#### Think-Pair-Share &mdash; ensuring every student voices their ideas

Many times throughout a lecture, a question is posed to the class and students discuss it with the person next to them. After a few minutes, each group shares what they discussed.
