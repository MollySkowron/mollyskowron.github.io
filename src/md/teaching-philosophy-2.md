1. [Students should uncover scientific knowledge through experimentation, inquiry, and modeling.](/page/philosophy1.html)<br>
   - **Jerome Bruner** &mdash; proposed that students should be engaging in discovery learning (constructivism), in which they must use their past experience and prior knowledge to solve problems and discover new information.<br>
   - **Noam Chomsky** &mdash; "passing tests doesn't begin to compare with searching and inquiring and pursuing topics that engage us and excite us...if that's the kind of educational career you're given the opportunity to pursue, you will remember what you discovered."

2. [Science instruction should create citizens that are critical consumers of information.](/page/philosophy2.html)<br>
   - **John Dewey** &mdash; the purpose of education is to make good citizens.<br>
   - **Mortimer J. Adler** &mdash; schooling should prepare students for the duties of citizenship and democracy.

3. [In the classroom, students should be respected and their ideas should be valued.](/page/philosophy3.html)<br>
   - **Lev Vygotsky** &mdash; a student's capabilities must be considered in relation to things they can do individually as well as things they can do when assisted. When assisted by the teacher or a peer, a student is learning in the zone of proximal development. The end goal is to have all students be able to complete the task individually.<br>
   - **Albert Bandura** &mdash; people with high self efficacy (those who believe that they can perform well) are more likely to view difficult tasks as something to be mastered rather than something to be avoided.


4. [Students should not be assessed on their ability to memorize and recite information, but on their ability to understand and apply information.](/page/philosophy4.html)<br>
   - **Ralph W. Tyler** &mdash; traditional testing is not a fair assessment of student growth. Assessment should be based on measuring objectives rather than memorization.<br>
   - **Benjamin Bloom** &mdash; memorization is ranked the lowest in Bloom's Taxonomy because he believed that it is the lowest form of cognitive process. Application and understanding are ranked above memorization.
