## Biology is a three-dimensional science and thus should be learned through three-dimensional modeling.

#### Modeling Activity

- Using pop-it beads in two different colors, students simulate each stage of mitosis and draw the models after each step
- Students then use the beads to simulate meiosis, drawing each step
- Students then fill out a chart documenting the similarities and differences of each stage in meiosis with its corresponding phase of mitosis
