## Students should uncover scientific knowledge through experimentation and inquiry.

#### Fertilization Activity
- Given an example of a skin cell for an organism, half of lab groups make sperm cells for that organism and the other half make egg cells
- Egg cells from one lab group are fertilized with sperm cells from the adjacent lab group. The number of chromosomes is counted
- Every group had offspring that contained double the amount of chromosomes than the parent had
- To solve this problem, students needed to work together to figure out that sperm and egg cells must contain half the amount of DNA that somatic cells contain.
