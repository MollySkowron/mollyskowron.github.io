## Students should uncover scientific knowledge through experimentation, inquiry, and modeling.

#### Inquiry Activity &mdash; gametes and fertilization
- Given an example of a regular cell for an organism, half of the lab groups made sperm cells for that organism and the other half made egg cells
- Egg cells from one lab group were fertilized with sperm cells from the adjacent lab group. The number of chromosomes was counted
- Every group had offspring that contained double the amount of chromosomes than the parent had
- To solve this problem, students needed to work together to figure out that sperm and egg cells must contain half the amount of DNA that somatic cells contain.

#### Modeling Activity &mdash; how do transcription and translation happen in 3D space?

- Students used a modeling kit to simulate the processes of transcription and translation
- After getting the chance to see the whole process in 3D, students worked with their groups to create a timeline of all the events that happen, and they attempted to identify the three stages of each process
- Students then shared their timelines with the rest of the class using a jigsaw format so that each student could see the timelines that all the other groups generated
